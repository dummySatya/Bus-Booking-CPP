loadfactor doesnt work, smth wrong with .bookedSeats attr
loadchanger, say one books 4/5 seats, that 0.8, so busesexceeding increases by one, but then someone books 5th seat, then again loadchanger is called and busesexceeding increases again but that shouldnt happen
loadchanger func increases the busesexceeding load on booking, but never decreases it on canceling

mapping required for seat to client details
    map
    busNos:{seatNo: clientID}
changing clients details when merging or book or cancel happens
forked server doesnt show up changes
